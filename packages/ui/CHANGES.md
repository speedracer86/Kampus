# Local changes to the design handoff

This package is the component library delivered from Claude Design ("Home schooling app design" handoff), kept as close to verbatim as possible. Divergences from the delivered files, and why:

- **Removed trailing `module.exports = {...}` lines from every `.jsx` file.** The files are ESM (they use `export function` throughout); the CommonJS lines were a gallery-bundling artifact and break ESM imports under Vite (`module` is undefined in the browser).

Everything else — styling, component behavior, the architecture contract in README.md — is untouched. Per the library's own rules: compose, don't restyle.

## v2 "Modern" pass — owner-directed redesign (Oct 2026)

Shastri asked for an Apple-style modernization: more depth and polish, same warm
palette, illustrations, and playfulness. This supersedes the original "compose,
don't restyle" rule for the changes below; everything else stays handoff-verbatim.

- `tokens.js`: radii up (10/14/20/999 — continuous, pill-friendly), layered soft
  shadows (`card`/`float`/`btn`), frosted-chrome tokens (`glass`, `hairline`,
  `glassBlur`), spring motion curves (`spring`, `motion.lift`), display tracking −.035em.
- `primitives.jsx`: Button is a pill; primary/ink lift on hover with shadow;
  outline variant became an Apple-style gray fill (borderless). Card and Chip are
  borderless — elevation separates surfaces, not strokes.
- `app.jsx`: NavBar is frosted glass (backdrop blur + hairline); nav items and the
  Kredit balance are pills; WorldTile lifts on hover (translate + float shadow)
  instead of darkening its border.
- `quiz.jsx`: answer tiles, quit button, coin chip, and end-of-round stat cards are
  borderless with soft elevation; feedback states still ring in green/red.
